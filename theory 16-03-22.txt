1.what is difference b/w constructor and fucntion in the class?
->*Constructor is used to initialize an object whereasmethod is used to exhibits functionality of an object.
  *Constructors are invoked implicitly whereas methods are invoked explicitly.
  *Constructor does not return any value where the method may/may not return a value.
  *In case constructor is not present, a default constructor is provided by java compiler.In the case of a method, no default method is provided.
  *Constructor should be of the same name as that of class. Method name should not be of the same name as that of class.

2.who gives default constructor?
->Java compiler automatically creates a default constructor (Constructor with no arguments) 
in case no constructor is present in the java class. Following are the motive behind a default constructor.
In case, programmer does not provide any constructor in class definition – JVM provides a 
default constructor to the class in runtime.

3.what are other responsibilities if jvm?
->The JVM performs following operation:
  *Loads code
  *Verifies code
  *Executes code
  *Provides runtime environment
  JVM provides definitions for the:
  *Memory area
  *Class file format
  *Register set
  *Garbage-collected heap
  *Fatal error reporting 

4.Is java call by reference or call by value?
->There is only call by value in java, not call by reference. If we call a method passing a value, it is known as call by value.
 The changes being done in the called method, is not affected in the calling method

5.who is providing the extra functions is java?
->java.lang Provides classes that are fundamental to the design of the Java programming language. The most important classes are Object, 
which is the root of the class hierarchy, and Class, instances of which represent classes at run time.

6.what happens if final keyword is applied on variable,class and method?
->Java final keyword is a non-access specifier that is used to restrict a class, variable, and method.
 If we initialize a variable with the final keyword, then we cannot modify its value.
 If we declare a method as final, then it cannot be overridden by any subclasses. 
 And, if we declare a class as final, we restrict the other classes to inherit or extend it.

7.why string is passed in main method?
->String args[], which is actually an array of java.lang.String type, and it's name is args here. 
It's not necessary to name it args always, you can name it strArray or whatever you like, but most programmer prefer to name it args, because that's what everyone else do. 
When we run a Java program from command prompt, we can pass some input to our Java program. 
Those inputs are stored in this String args array. For example if we modify our program to 
print content of String args[].

8.why only jvm gives default constructor?
->Because When it comes to object creation in Java it becomes necessary to understand how does the compiler handles constructor creation in Java. Constructor is a block of code which helps us to 
initialize the new object in java and gives it a state and behaviour.

9.difference b/w java 8 and java7?
->*The codename for java 7 is dolphin and the codeman for java 8 is spider
  *Some of the features of Java 7 are Handling of Multiple exceptions,
   Updated class-loader architecture, Enhanced type inference, Updated Rowset 1.1 and JDBC 4.1, Enhanced Managed Beans, Automatic resource management in try-statement, Compressed 64-bit pointers, JVM support and so much more
  *Whereas Some of the features of Java 8 are Lambda Expressions, Interface default and 
   Static Methods, Unsigned Integer Arithmetic, Concurrent API enhancements, Null Reference Template, New JavaScript Engine, Nashorn, New and improved Stream API, Withdrawal of permanent generation and so much more.
  *Java 7 was developed by Oracle Corporation on Jan 27, 2010 whereas java 8 was developed by Oracle Corporation on Mar 18, 2014
  *Main upgrade for java 7 is JVM support for dynamically-typed languages  whereas for java 8
  *Java 7 is supported on windows XP whereas java 8 is not supported on Windows XP but forced installation can be done

10.when and why collections were added?
->The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.
Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.
Java Collection means a single unit of objects. 
Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).
The Collection framework represents a unified architecture for storing and manipulating a group of objects

11.difference b/w collection and collections?
->Collection	                                           Collections
*It is an interface.	                                  *It is a utility class.
*It is used to represent a group of                     *It defines several utility methods that are used to operate on collection.
individual objects as a single unit.                               
*The Collection is an interface that                    *It contains only static methods.
contains a static method since java8. 
The Interface can also contain abstract 
and default methods.


//function without  parameter and without retunr type

12.difference betweeen enumerator and iterator?
->Enumeration and Iterator In Java :
Enumeration	                                          Iterator
*Using Enumeration, you can only                 *Using Iterator, you can remove an element of
traverse the collection. You can’t do            the collection while traversing it.
any modifications to collection while
traversing it.	
*Enumeration is introduced in JDK 1.0	          *Iterator is introduced from JDK 1.2
*Enumeration is used to traverse the             *Iterator is used to iterate most of the classes in 
legacy classes like Vector, Stack                the collection framework like ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap, LinkedList etc.
and HashTable.	
*Methods : hasMoreElements() and nextElement()	 *Methods : hasNext(), next() and remove()
*Enumeration is fail-safe in nature.	          *Iterator is fail-fast in nature.
*Enumeration is not safe and secured 	          *Iterator is safer and secured than Enumeration.
due to it’s fail-safe nature.

13.->There Cannot be try Block Without Catch Block.
   if There is a Try Block It compulsory to Have a Catch Block.
   Finally Block is Optional to have or not.
